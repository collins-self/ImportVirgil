## All of Virgil
This is a Java program I needed for a "Pick a random line of Virgil's poetry" site I want to make.  
If you need this for *some* reason, clone it:  
```
git clone https://github.com/collins-self/ImportVirgil.git
```
Then I set it up with IntelliJ, so I *imagine* you could just run it in an IDE, but you can also manually compile.  
First, I'd delete the IDE files I have:  
```
rm -rf ./out RemoveNumbers.iml
cd src
```
Then compile in the directory with:  
```
javac *.java
java AllOfVirg
```
Thanks for letting me solve this incredibly niche problem for you!
